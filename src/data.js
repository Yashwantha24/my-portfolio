    bio: "I'm a Full Stack Developer and student passionate about building scalable web applications using the MERN stack and Java technologies.",
    about: "I am currently a student pursuing my degree in Computer Science. My journey in software development started with a curiosity for how things work on the web, which led me to master the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), Java, and Python. I enjoy solving complex problems and building efficient, user-friendly applications.\n\nI have experience working on various academic and personal projects, ranging from job portals to dynamic web applications. I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills.",
